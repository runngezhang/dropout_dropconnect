As we were running multiple GPU servers on Amazon AWS we have different files for every experiments. 
Below is a short explanation for the jupyter notebook. 


1. MNIST_nodrop_dropout_experiments.ipynb
	following experiments were run on this notebook. 
	a)No-drop on linear
	b)No-drop on tanh
	c)No-drop on sigmoid
	d)Dropout with linear 
	e)Dropout with tanh	
	f)Dropout with sigmoid 
	g)Dropout with changing hidden units
	h)No-Drop changing hidden layers
	i)Dropout for different values of p.
		Note that as we lost the connection in between for p = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5], we
		copy-pasted the results. 

2.MNIST_dropconnect_sigmoid.ipnyb
